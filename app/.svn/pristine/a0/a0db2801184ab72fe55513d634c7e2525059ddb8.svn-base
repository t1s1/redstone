<h1>Breaks</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The proctor should exercise active proctoring when any candidate has left for a break.<br>
    - Watch the candidate as he or she walks to the restroom to be sure that he or she does not stop to speak to anyone or engage in suspicious behavior.<br>
    - Make sure that the candidate does not access personal belongings during a break.<br>
    - Take note of any candidate who is taking frequent or lengthy breaks.<br>
    - Conduct a sweep of bathrooms and other break areas daily to make sure no prohibited items have been stowed away from the sight of proctors.
  </li>
</ul>
