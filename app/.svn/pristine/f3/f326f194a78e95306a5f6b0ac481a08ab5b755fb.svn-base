<h1>Supervising Candidates and Detecting Cheating</h1>
<ul>
  <li>If a proctor detects suspicious behavior, he or she should:  <br>
    - Ask another proctor, if possible, to verify that the behavior is suspicious.<br>
    - Describe to the candidate what has been observed and tell the candidate to refrain from continuing the behavior. Move the candidate to another seat if necessary.<br>
    - Inform the candidate that the proctor is required to report any and all suspicious behavior, but the candidate may continue testing and can also respond to the report after the exam time ends and prior to leaving the exam site.
  </li>
</ul>
