<h1>Breaks</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The candidate may take a break at any time as long as no other tester is currently taking a break </li>
  <li>Candidates can take a break to use the restroom, get a drink of water, or stretch.</li>
  <li>Candidates are not allowed to leave the testing center or access personal belongings during breaks.</li>
  <li>Please advise testers that the time spent on a break will not be made up; it is deducted from the overall testing time, unless the break is scheduled between the morning and afternoon testing session.</li>
</ul>
