<h1>Proctoring High-Stakes Examinations</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The Failing Score Report:<br>
    - Because high-stakes exams are very important, candidates may react strongly to a failing score report.<br>
    - Proctors must remember to keep all score reports confidential at all times.<br>
    - Proctors should remain neutral to all candidates, no matter their passing status.<br>
    - Proctors can direct any upset candidates to Castle's main number or email address if the candidate would like to make comments about the exam.
