<h1>Supervising Candidates and Detecting Cheating</h1>
<ul>
  <li>To prevent and detect cheating, proctors should:<br>
    - Strictly follow the check-in and seating procedures outlined in the Proctor Manual as well as in this training.<br>
    Carefully check each candidate's photo ID and verify the signature on the ID against his or her signature on the roster<br>
    Do not allow candidates to choose their own seats. Seat candidates at least 3 to 4 feet apart.<br>
    - Perform a sweep of the testing center at least daily.<br>
    - Remain vigilant at all times, watching for all suspicious behavior.<br>
    <br>
    - Review the &quot;Common Ways to Cheat&quot; table in your proctor manual.
